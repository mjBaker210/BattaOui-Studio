<p> I was in my break and locked out of my car. In a panic I called <span>Phillip's Lock and Key</span>. I was so impressed with the speed of his response and the friendly attitude of the locksmith and he had me on my way in no time. I would highly recommend him to my friends and family anytime.......

<p> lost my key fob today and called my dealership for assistance. As they did not have a mobile service, I had to find a tow truck to take my car about 5 blocks to the dealership.I called four tow truck companies to get a tow on a rainy Monday. 3 companies told me they could not help until tomorrow. The fourth said perhaps they could be there in 4-5 hours, but there was no guarantee. I then looked on the Internet and  <strong>Phillip's Lock & Key</strong>  came right up. I called and Phillip answered right away. He was on his way to Schertz, but turned around immediately to help me. Within two hours I have a new key and can drive my car! Amazing customer service, fast, safe and reliable. I highly recommend Phillip's Lock & Key!

<p>After someone broke into my home overnight damaging the front door, I called<strong> Phillip’s Lock and Key</strong>,I am certainly glad that I did. He came out to my home in the middle of the night.   The  door &amp; lock was repaired before you know it. I was certainly impressed with the service &amp; his knowledge of security systems. We were able to upgrade for very little.
